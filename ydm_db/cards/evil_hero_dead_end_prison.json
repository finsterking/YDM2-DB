You can only Special Summon \"Evil HERO Dead-End Prison\" once per turn this way. You can send 1 \"HERO\" monster from your Deck to the GY; if you Fusion Summon a \"HERO\" monster this turn, this face-up card can be used as a substitute for 1 material mentioned by name, but all other Fusion Materials must be correct. You can only use this effect of \"Evil HERO Dead-End Prison\" once per turn.",
