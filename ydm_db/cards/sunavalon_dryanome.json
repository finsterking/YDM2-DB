Three times per turn, if you take battle or effect damage: You can gain that much LP, and if you do, Special Summon 1 \"Sunvine\" monster from your Extra Deck. Once per turn, when a monster this card points to is targeted for an attack: You can negate the attack, and if you do, move that monster you control to another of your Main Monster Zones.",
