Your opponent cannot target \"Traptrix\" monsters you control, except \"Traptrix Rafflesia\", with card effects. Once per turn, during either player's turn: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card and send 1 \"Hole\" Normal Trap Card that meets its activation conditions from your Deck to the Graveyard; this effect becomes that Trap Card's effect when that card is activated.",
