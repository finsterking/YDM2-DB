Monsters with Crystallization Counters are considered Continuous Spell Cards in your Spell & Trap Zone instead of monsters. If a card with a Crystallization Counter would be Special Summoned, remove the counter. Cards with Crystallization Counters can be used as Fusion Material for \"Ultimate Crystal\" monsters.",
