(Xyz Materials attached to that monster also become Xyz Materials on this card.) Once per turn: You can target 1 \"Number\" monster in your Graveyard; Special Summon it in Defense Position, but its effects are negated. During either player's turn, when a monster effect is activated that targets this face-up card: You can detach 1 Xyz Material from this card; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card.",
