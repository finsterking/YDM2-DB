If your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) and they activated monster effects 4 or more times this turn: You can Special Summon 1 \"Jurrac Meteor\" from your Extra Deck. (This is treated as a Synchro Summon.) If a \"Jurrac\" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by card effect, you can banish 1 Dinosaur monster from your GY instead. You can only use each effect of \"Jurrac Volcano\" once per turn.",
