If your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) and they have activated 4 or more monster effects this turn (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon 1 \"Jurrac Meteor\" from your Extra Deck (this is treated as a Synchro Summon). If a \"Jurrac\" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by card effect, you can banish 1 Dinosaur monster from your GY instead. You can only use each effect of \"Jurrac Volcano\" once per turn.",
