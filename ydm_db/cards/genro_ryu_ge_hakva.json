If a monster is banished face-up, this card is already banished, and there are now at least 2 other banished monsters that are not \"Genro Ryu-Ge Hakva\" (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this banished card. You can place 1 \"Ryu-Ge Realm - Wyrm Winds\" you control on the bottom of the Deck; add 1 \"Ryu-Ge\" card from your Deck, GY, or banishment to your hand, except \"Genro Ryu-Ge Hakva\". You can only use each effect of \"Genro Ryu-Ge Hakva\" once per turn.",
