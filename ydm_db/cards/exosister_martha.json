You cannot Special Summon monsters the turn you activate this effect, except \"Exosister\" monsters. If a card(s) moves out of either GY (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 \"Exosister\" Xyz Monster, using this face-up card you control as material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon.) You can only use each effect of \"Exosister Martha\" once per turn.",
